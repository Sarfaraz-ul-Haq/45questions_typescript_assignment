// Great Magicians

// Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

// Exercise 41
const magician_names = ["David Blaine", "David Copperfield", "Criss Angel"];

// function to display each name of the array
const show_magicians = (magicianArr: string[]) => {
  for (const magician of magicianArr) {
    console.log(magician);
  }
};

show_magicians(magician_names);

// make_great() function that iterates through the magician_names array and  adds "the Great" to every name
const make_great = () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < magician_names.length; i++) {
    magician_names[i] = `${magician_names[i]} the Great`;
  }
};
make_great();
show_magicians(magician_names);
