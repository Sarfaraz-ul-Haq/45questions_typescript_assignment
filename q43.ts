// Unchanged Magicians

// Start with your work from Exercise 42. Call the function make_great() with a copy of the array of magicians’ names. Because the original array will be unchanged, return the new array and store it in a separate array. Call show_magicians() with each array to show that you have one array of the original names and one array with the Great added to each magician’s name.

const magician_names = ["David Blaine", "David Copperfield", "Criss Angel"];
const magician_names_copy = [...magician_names];

// function to display each name of the array
const show_magicians = (arr: string[]) => {
  for (const magician of arr) {
    console.log(magician);
  }
};

// make_great() function that iterates through the "magician_names_copy" array and  adds "the Great" to every name
const make_great = (): string[] => {
  for (let i = 0; i < magician_names_copy.length; i++) {
    magician_names_copy[i] = `${magician_names_copy[i]} the Great`;
  }
  return magician_names_copy;
};

const newArr = make_great();

show_magicians(magician_names);
show_magicians(newArr);
