// Cars

// Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

const carInfoFunc = (
  manufacturer: string,
  model_name: string,
  keywordArguments: { [key: string]: any }
) => {
  let carInfo = {
    manufacturer: manufacturer,
    model_name: model_name,
    ...keywordArguments,
  };

  return carInfo;
};

const info = carInfoFunc("BMW", "BMW i7", {
  color: "Black",
  optionalFeature: "Sunroof",
});

console.log(info);
